Bugs:
[ ] idt_descr is already marked __ro_after_init. However, the plugin is unable to detect this section
    name, and as a result flags it for annotation.
	- There are objects that are already annotated that are successfully ignored. For eg:
	"notes_attr"(struct bin_attribute).
[ ] The plugin has trouble iterating over the field of certain struct types. This was noticed in the case
    of "gro_cells".
[ ] Writes via a pointer are ignored.  For eg: instance "mtrr_state" seems to have writes but does not
    get flagged

Improvements:
[ ] Currently the number of pages in the cache is hardcoded. It would be better to just dynamically
    truncate the cache size when necessary.

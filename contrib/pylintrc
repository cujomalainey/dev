# CHANGE: The ChromiumOS standard is different than PEP-8, so we need to
# redefine this. Here's what we allow:
# - CamelCaps, starting with a capital letter.  No underscores in function
#   names.  Can also have a "_" prefix (private method) or a "test" prefix
#   (unit test).
# - Methods that look like __xyz__, which are used to do things like
#   __init__, __del__, etc.
# - setUp, tearDown: For unit tests.
